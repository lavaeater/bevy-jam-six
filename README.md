# Bevy Jam Six

## Gameplay loop

It is the glorious Chain Reaction Death Race 3000 and you have qualified for it!

The racers are in their start places. A light counts down, red, yellow, green.

The race is off! 

The race track is a loop. The race is three laps. 

The first race isn't that hard. You qualify for the next race, the top three do that. 

During the race, you can pick up powerups. They are chain-based. Are they? Should they be?

Is the racing and chain-thing a thing, really?
